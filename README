NAME
    DBD::Salesforce - Treat Salesforce as a datasource for DBI

SYNOPSIS
      use DBI;

      my $dbh = DBI->connect("dbi:Salesforce", $id, $pass);
      my $sth = $dbh->prepare(qq[
          SELECT id, firstname, lastname FROM contact
      ]);

      while (my $r = $sth->fetchrow_hashref) {
          ...

DESCRIPTION
    "DBD::Salesforce" allows you to use Salesforce as a datasource;
    Salesforce can be queried using SQL *SELECT* statements, and iterated
    over using standard DBI conventions.

    WARNING: This is still alpha-quality software. It works for me, but that
    doesn't really mean anything.
